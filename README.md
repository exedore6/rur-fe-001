# RUR-FE-001

## Memo Regarding RUR-FE-001
**Department:** Product Research and Development
**Design Lead:** Daniel (exedore6) Clery <dan.clery@gmail.com>

### Executive Summary

The RUR-FE-001 is a piece of field equipment to be issued to our engineers
for the purpose of developing, troubleshooting, and maintaining future 
models. At this time, off the shelf equipment does not satisfy out needs.

The RUR-FE-001 is a portable computer, with the following properties, listed
in order of importance.
  * Flexabilty in function. Key elements can be reconfigured in the field
    by the operator. This is provide by adding some ports that otherwise would
    be routed internally to be reconfigured using patch cables.
  * Ease of use, for a technical user. Ultimatley, this system will be optimized
    for a keyboard-first use case. Activities such as coding will be prioritized, 
    followed by human interface devices for other systems.
  * Mobility. Portablity and autonomy is critical - device should continue to 
    fulfill it's core function off the grid. Accessories for various RF technology
    and power sources will be easily integrated into the system. System speed will
    be of low priority over runtime.


## OUT OF CHARACTER
    I'm building a cyberdeck. Right now, I'm envisioning a two
    part system. Part 1 is a combination touchscreen/display/powerbank/computer.
    Part 2 is a combination keyboard/gamepad/powerbank/computer. Ideally they would
    both function independently, or be combined in useful ways.

    As much as practical, I intend on doing the design work using open source tools.
    Additionally, while it's likely that I'll unable to fulfill all electronic elements
    through open source designs, I would like to keep the number of items that rely
    on closed development and configuration tools and lack full schematics available to
    a minimum. Independence from any manufacturer is important.
